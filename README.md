**1. k_means_clustering_numpy.ipynb:** Implemented K-means clustering from scratch using numpy to analyze a dataset of crime statistics provided by the Baltimore Police Department. The goal is to divide the city of Baltimore into clusters by crime distribution to aid law enforcement.

**2. logistic_regression_numpy.ipynb:** Implemented logistic regression with and without Adagrad from scratch using numpy. The implementation was tested on a dataset of students' grades to determine the likelihood of students getting into a particular school by the results of two exams.

**3. rnn_stratafied_sampling_pytorch.ipynb:** Implemented a recurrent neural network architecture using PyTorch to classify surnames according to their language of origin. Extensive data pre-processing was performed in order to load data points into the model.
